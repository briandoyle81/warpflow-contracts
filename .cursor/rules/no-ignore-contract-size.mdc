# Contract size: do not ignore for compilation

You are **never** allowed to turn on or enable "ignore contract size" (or equivalent) for compilation.

- Do **not** add or set options that skip or ignore contract size checks (e.g. in Hardhat, Solidity config, or contract-sizer).
- Do **not** suggest disabling or bypassing the 24 KiB deployment / 24 KiB init size limits.
- If contracts exceed size limits, reduce size by refactoring, libraries, or optimizer settings—do not disable the check.

This applies to any config that would ignore or suppress contract size warnings/errors (e.g. `ignoreContractSizeLimit`, `ignoreSizeLimit`, or similar in this repo).
