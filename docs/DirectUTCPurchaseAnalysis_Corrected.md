# Direct UTC Purchase Analysis - Corrected

## User's Statement

**"Being able to purchase 125 UTC for 100 Flow doesn't change the economic balance does it? It just removes the recycling step."**

## The Economics

### Current System: Purchase Ships + Recycle

**Purchase 125 ships for 100 FLOW:**

- Player spends: 100 FLOW
- 50% Referrer gets: 50 FLOW
- Owner gets: 50 FLOW
- Player recycles: Gets 12.5 UC
- **Player net: Spent 50 FLOW (after referral), got 12.5 UC**

### Proposed: Direct UTC Purchase

**Purchase 125 UTC for 100 FLOW:**

- Player spends: 100 FLOW
- Owner gets: 100 FLOW
- Player gets: 125 UTC
- **Player net: Spent 100 FLOW, got 125 UTC**

## Key Insight

**The user is correct!** If you offer 125 UTC for 100 FLOW directly, it's economically equivalent to the recycling path, but from YOUR perspective (the owner), not the player's.

### Why It's Equivalent (From Owner's Perspective)

**Recycling Path:**

- Owner receives: 50 FLOW (50% of 100 FLOW purchase)
- Recycling mints: 12.5 UC (to player)
- Owner must burn: 12.5 UC (to maintain price)
- **Owner net: 50 FLOW, -12.5 UC burned**

**Direct Purchase Path (if you mint):**

- Owner receives: 100 FLOW
- Owner mints: 125 UTC (to player)
- Owner must burn: 125 UTC (to maintain price)
- **Owner net: 100 FLOW, -125 UTC burned**

**Wait, that's not equivalent...** Let me recalculate.

### Corrected Analysis

**Recycling Path (125 ships for 100 FLOW):**

- Owner receives: 50 FLOW
- Player gets: 12.5 UC from recycling
- Owner must burn: 12.5 UC to maintain price
- **Owner net: 50 FLOW, -12.5 UC**

**Direct Purchase (125 UTC for 100 FLOW):**

- Owner receives: 100 FLOW
- Owner mints: 125 UTC
- Owner must burn: 125 UTC to maintain price
- **Owner net: 100 FLOW, -125 UC**

**These are NOT equivalent!** The direct purchase gives you 2x the FLOW but requires 10x the burn.

### But Wait - The User's Point

The user might be saying: **"If I offer 125 UTC for 100 FLOW, it's the same as if they bought ships and recycled, because I get the FLOW either way."**

**Recycling Path:**

- Player spends: 100 FLOW
- You get: 50 FLOW (after 50% referral)
- Player gets: 12.5 UC (from recycling)
- You must burn: 12.5 UC

**Direct Purchase Path:**

- Player spends: 100 FLOW
- You get: 100 FLOW (no referral)
- Player gets: 125 UTC (from direct purchase)
- You must burn: 125 UTC

**The difference:**

- You get 2x more FLOW (100 vs 50)
- But you must burn 10x more UTC (125 vs 12.5)
- **This is NOT economically equivalent!**

## The Real Question

**What rate makes it equivalent?**

If recycling gives player 12.5 UC for 50 FLOW net cost:

- Rate: 50 FLOW / 12.5 UC = 4 FLOW per UC
- So 125 UC should cost: 125 × 4 = 500 FLOW

**But the user says "125 UTC for 100 FLOW"** which is:

- Rate: 100 FLOW / 125 UC = 0.8 FLOW per UC

**This is 5x better for the player!**

## Corrected Analysis: Understanding the User's Perspective

**The user is saying:** "I get the FLOW if they purchase UTC directly, so it's the same as if they bought ships - I just get the full 100 FLOW instead of 50 FLOW (after referral)."

### Recycling Path (125 ships for 100 FLOW)

**From Owner's Perspective:**

- Owner receives: 50 FLOW (after 50% referral paid out)
- Player gets: 12.5 UC (minted from recycling)
- Owner must burn: 12.5 UC (to maintain price)
- **Owner net: 50 FLOW, -12.5 UC**

### Direct Purchase Path (125 UTC for 100 FLOW)

**From Owner's Perspective:**

- Owner receives: 100 FLOW (no referral paid)
- Owner mints: 125 UTC (to player)
- Owner must burn: 125 UTC (to maintain price)
- **Owner net: 100 FLOW, -125 UC**

### The Key Insight

**The user is correct IF:**

- You're comparing the FLOW you receive
- You're not accounting for the UTC burn requirement

**But economically, they're NOT equivalent:**

- You get 2x more FLOW (100 vs 50) ✓
- But you must burn 10x more UTC (125 vs 12.5) ✗

### The Real Question: What Rate Makes It Equivalent?

**To make it economically equivalent, you need:**

**Option 1: Match the net cost to player**

- Player net cost via recycling: 50 FLOW for 12.5 UC
- Rate: 4 FLOW per UC
- So offer: 12.5 UTC for 50 FLOW (not 125 UTC for 100 FLOW)

**Option 2: Match the gross cost to player**

- Player gross cost via recycling: 100 FLOW for 12.5 UC
- Rate: 8 FLOW per UC
- So offer: 12.5 UTC for 100 FLOW (not 125 UTC for 100 FLOW)

**Option 3: Match your net revenue**

- You get 50 FLOW from recycling path
- You must burn 12.5 UC
- To get 50 FLOW from direct purchase, offer: 12.5 UTC for 50 FLOW
- This matches the recycling economics

## Conclusion

**If you offer 125 UTC for 100 FLOW:**

**From FLOW perspective:** You get 2x more FLOW (100 vs 50) ✓

**From UTC perspective:** You must burn 10x more UTC (125 vs 12.5) ✗

**This is NOT economically equivalent** - you're giving players a much better rate (0.8 FLOW per UC vs 4 FLOW per UC net, or 8 FLOW per UC gross).

**To make it equivalent, you should offer:**

- **12.5 UTC for 50 FLOW** (matches recycling net cost to player)
- Or **12.5 UTC for 100 FLOW** (matches recycling gross cost to player)

**The user's statement is partially correct** - you do get the FLOW either way, but the UTC economics are NOT equivalent. Offering 125 UTC for 100 FLOW is 5-10x better for players than recycling.
